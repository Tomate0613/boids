# Boids
This mod replaces the vanilla fish behavior of flocking fish with a boids simulation.

## What's a Boids Simulation?
A "boids simulation" refers to a computer model that simulates the flocking or herding behavior observed in nature, like the coordinated movement of birds or fish. In the context of this mod, it means fish will exhibit more realistic and dynamic group movements, making your aquatic environments come to life.

In particular, each fish will follow these three rules:
- Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
- Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
